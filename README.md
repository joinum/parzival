## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. Start by creating an
environment file and fill them with valid values.

```
bin/setup (--docker | --local) [ENVIRONMENT]
```

### üì• Prerequisites

There are two options when it comes to setting up your development environment.
The Docker based one boils down to running a single command and is most likely
what you want, especially when getting started. The following software is
required if you want to follow a Docker base approach.

- [Docker 20+](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Docker Compose 2+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)


If you prefer a local setup (to have more control) the following software is
required to be installed on your system.

- [Erlang 24+](https://www.erlang.org/downloads)
- [Elixir 1.13+](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
- [PostgreSQL 14+](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

We recommend using [asdf version
manager](https://asdf-vm.com/) to install and
manage all the programming languages' requirements if you want to run locally.

### üê≥ Docker

To start all the services (database and webapp) run:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f {linux,darwin}.yml up
```

If you only want to start the database run:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f {linux,darwin}.yml up db
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è  Local Setup

You need to setup the database beforehand and then run:

```
mix setup
```

### üî® Development

Start the development server and then you can visit
[`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

```
mix phx.server
```
